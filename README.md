## **Usage:**

Requirements for using the project:

First, create a test.txt file that contains the wallet addresses. Each wallet address in this file should be on a separate line.
Then run the KayaAI.exe file.
The application begins to check the balances of the specified wallet addresses. Wallets with balance are recorded in a file named completed.txt.
Note: Both the test.txt file and the KayaAI.exe file must be in the same location.

## **Description:**
This tool uses the kaya-ai.com API to check the balances of the specified wallet addresses. An API call is made for each wallet address, and the result is recorded in the completed.txt file.

In addition, the application displays the wallet addresses being checked and any possible errors on the screen to inform the user and make the experience more user-friendly.
